	\section{Introduction}
	
	\section{Review of the International State of Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Mechanisms, Philosophy and Effectiveness}
	
	Will mainly be  focus on Uk but we will look elsewhere in the world for examples and comparisons. 
	\subsection{Definitions} 
	John stockie essay \cite{Stockie2015}.

	Dutch Deloitte Report 
	\subsection{Mechanisms}
	European Study Groups in Industry 
	
	Some study group reports 
	
	Innovate UK /Knowledge Transfer Network 
	
	Smith institute
	
	Canadian examples - CQAM, Fields 
	\subsection{Successes}
	BOND Review 
	\subsection{Challenges}

	\subsubsection{Identifying Suitable Problems and Creating links} 
	Especially SMEs 
	\subsubsection{Building working relationships}
	A long process!!!!
	Intellectual Property issues 
	\subsubsection{Funding} 
	Talk about Bond Review and about 100 phd student places etc, boosting of EPSRC funding etc 
	\subsubsection{Academic Career Paths} 
	Needs to be seen as a viable career option 
	How to prevent people being snaffled to industry 
	\subsubsection{Brexit}
	I am reluctant to mention the 'B' word but i think no report that looks at the future of Mathematical Research, Industry or Mathematics in Industry can avoid the topic. The whole scientific community is concerned over the future of funding and ability to collaborate (BREXIT LETTER NOBEL LAUREATES) and industry in the UK is facing an uncertain future (REFERENCE OR MORE HERE).
	
	I don't want to spend much time on this, but I would like to say that whatever happens, examples of success stories in industrial mathemtatics have demonstrated the need for callobaration: with industry, with other fields, with other departments and it will be vital for the continuing success of Industrial Mathematics that the spirit of callaboration is maintained.
