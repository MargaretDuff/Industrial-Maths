abstract = {Time reversal of ultrasonic fields represents a way to focus through an inhomogeneous medium. This may be accomplished by a time-reversal mirror (TRM) made from an array of transmit-receive transducers that respond linearly and allow the incident acoustic pressure to be sampled. The pressure field is then time-reversed and re-emitted. This process can be used to focus through inhomogeneous media on a reflective target that behaves as an acoustic source after being insonified. The time-reversal approach is introduced in a discussion of the classical techniques used for focusing pulsed waves through inhomogeneous media (adaptive time-delay techniques). Pulsed wave time-reversal focusing is shown using reciprocity valid in inhomogeneous medium to be optimal in the sense that it realizes the spatial-temporal matched filter to the inhomogeneous propagation transfer function between the array and the target. The research on time-reversed wave fields has also led to the development of new concepts that are described: time-reversal cavity that extends the concept of the TRM, and iterative time-reversal processing for automatic sorting of targets according to their reflectivity and resonating of extended targets.},

@article{Borcea2002,
abstract = {We present a general method for estimating the location of small, well-separated scatterers in a randomly inhomogeneous environment using an active sensor array. The main features of this method are (i) an arrival time analysis (ATA) of the echo received from the scatterers, (ii) a singular value decomposition of the array response matrix in the frequency domain, and (iii) the construction of an objective function in the time domain that is statistically stable and peaks on the scatterers. By statistically stable we mean here that the objective function is self-averaging over individual realizations of the medium. This is a new approach to array imaging that is motivated by time reversal in random media, analysed in detail previously. It combines features from seismic imaging, like ATA, with frequency-domain signal subspace methodology like multiple signal classification. We illustrate the theory with numerical simulations for ultrasound.},

@unpublished{Stockie2015,
abstract = {"I am an industrial mathematician." When asked to identify my profession or academic field of study, this is the most concise answer I can provide. However, this seemingly straightforward statement is commonly greeted by a blank stare or an uncomfortable silence, regardless of whether I am speaking to a fellow mathematician or a non-mathematician. I usually follow up with the clarification: "I am an applied mathematician who derives much of my inspiration from the study of industrial problems that I encounter through collaborations with companies." This dispels some confusion, but unfortunately still leaves a great deal open to interpretation owing to the vagueness of the words mathematics, industry and company, each of which covers an extremely broad range of scientific or socio-economic activity. To those academics who actually work in the field of industrial mathematics (and whose "perspective" referred to in the title is the focus of this article) this ambiguity is familiar and untroubling. However, for anyone less acquainted with the work of industrial mathematicians, some clarification is desirable especially for anyone who might be considering entering the field. This essay therefore aims to shed light upon the nature of research being done at the interface between mathematics and industry, paying particular attention to the following questions: What is industrial mathematics? Where is industrial mathematics? How does one do industrial mathematics? Why (or more precisely, what value is there in doing) industrial mathematics? I will attempt to answer these questions by means of several case studies drawn from my own experience in tackling mathematical problems from industry.},

abstract = {Research to assess the feasibility of developing a standoo active or passive optical tripwire detector is discussed. Reeectivities of typical tripwires and background materials were measured for UV, VNIR and SWIR wavelengths. A breadboard testbed was developed to obtain images of tripwires against various backgrounds for various geometries and a wide range of UV and VNIR wavelengths. Sample images of simulated and real tripwires in uncluttered environments and against typical cluttered backgrounds were acquired and analyzed. Line detection algorithms were applied to the images to detect tripwires. Although detection was not attempted in real-time, analysis showed that available, cost-eeective DSPs could potentially execute those algorithms on the images in real-time. The algorithms successfully detected tripwires in a heavily cluttered background and even have the capability to detect partially obscured wires. To complement the measurements, a spreadsheet model was developed to evaluate the merits of diierent detectors, sources of illumination, wavebands and geometries for diierent scenarios. Acceptable signal-to-clutter ratios were found for a number of reasonable passive and active illumination scenarios. The study demonstrated that an optical tripwire detector is feasible in principle.},

abstract = {A bioheat transfer approach is proposed to study thermal damage in biological tissues caused by laser radiation. The laser light propagation in the tissue is first solved by using a robust seven-flux model in cylindrical coordinate system. The resulting spatial distribution of the absorbed laser energy is incorporated into the bioheat transfer equation for solving temperature response. Thermal damage to the tissue is assessed by the extent of denatured protein using a rate process equation. It is found that for the tissue studied, a significant protein denaturation process would take place when temperature exceeds about 53 • C. The effects of laser power, exposure time and beam size as well as the tissue absorption and scattering coefficients on the thermal damage process are examined and discussed. The laser conditions that cause irreversible damage to the tissue are also identified.

abstract = {The relationship between housing costs and homelessness has important implications for the way that city and county governments respond to increasing homeless populations. Though many analyses in the public policy literature have examined inter-community variation in homelessness rates to identify causal mechanisms of homelessness (Byrne et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2003; Fargo et al., 2013), few studies have examined time-varying homeless counts within the same community (McCandless et al., 2016). To examine trends in homeless population counts in the 25 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, we develop a dynamic Bayesian hierarchical model for time-varying homeless count data. Particular care is given to modeling uncertainty in the homeless count generating and measurement processes, and a critical distinction is made between the counted number of homeless and the true size of the homeless population. For each metro under study, we investigate the relationship between increases in the Zillow Rent Index and increases in the homeless population. Sensitivity of inference to potential improvements in the accuracy of point-in-time counts is explored, and evidence is presented that the inferred increase in the rate of homelessness from 2011-2016 depends on prior beliefs about the accuracy of homeless counts. A main finding of the study is that the relationship between homelessness and rental costs is strongest in New York, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Seattle.},

abstract = {Paris is an array of microphones and loudspeakers. If you stand in front of this array and speak into it, anything you say comes back at you, but played in reverse. Your "hello" echoes-almost instantaneously-as "olleh." At first this may seem as ordinary as playing a tape backward, but there is a twist: the sound is projected back exactly toward its source. Instead of spreading throughout the room from the loudspeakers, the sound of the "olleh" converges onto your mouth, almost as if time itself had been reversed. Indeed , the process is known as time-reversed acoustics, and the array in front of you is acting as a "time-reversal mirror." Such mirrors are more than just a novelty item. They have a range of applications, including destruction of tumors and kidney stones, detection of defects in metals, and long-distance communication and mine detection in the ocean. Arrays of transducers can recreate a sound and send it back to its source as if time had been reversed. The process can be used to destroy kidney stones, detect defects in materials and communicate with submarines},

abstract = {A 256-element, continuous-wave ultrasonic phased array has been used to thermally coagulate deep-seated liver and kidney tissue. The array elements were formed on a 1-3 piezocomposite bowl with a 10-cm radius of curvature and 12-cm diameter. The 0.65 0.65 cm 2 projection elements were driven at 1.1 MHz by a custom-built amplifier system. A series of in vivo porcine experiments demonstrated the ability to coagulate liver and kidney tissue using the large-scale phased array. The temperature response of the treatment was guided and monitored using magnetic resonance (MR) images. Focal lesion volumes greater than 0.5 cm 3 in kidney and 2 cm 3 in liver were formed from a single 20-s sonication.},

abstract = {A precise definition of the basic reproduction number, R 0 , is presented for a general compartmental disease transmission model based on a system of ordinary differential equations. It is shown that, if R 0 {\textless} 1, then the disease free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable; whereas if R 0 {\textgreater} 1, then it is unstable. Thus, R 0 is a threshold parameter for the model. An analysis of the local centre manifold yields a simple criterion for the existence and stability of super-and sub-threshold endemic equilibria for R 0 near one. This criterion, together with the definition of R 0 , is illustrated by treatment, multigroup, staged progression, multistrain and vector-host models and can be applied to more complex models. The results are significant for disease control.},

The model, which applies to a single local authority, is analysed to see how changing priorities can affect waiting times and the size of the waiting list for council accommodation. The analysis shows that, if the number of homeless is reasonably small, then altering the priority given to them makes little difference to the waiting times for other members of the population. However, lowering the priority given to rehousing the homeless significantly increases the time which they have to wait. Time scales which appear in the model indicate that the determination of steady states will not always suffice to predict the sizes of waiting lists over times of practical interest. A possible sensitive dependence on the amount of housing stock is also found.},

abstract = {Preclinical studies indicate that focused ultrasound at exposure conditions close to the threshold for thermal damage can increase drug delivery at the focal region. Although these results are promising, the optimal control of temperature still remains a challenge. To address this issue, computer-simulated ultrasound treatments have been performed. When the treatments are delivered without taking into account the cooling effect exerted by the blood flow, the resulting thermal dose is highly variable with regions of thermal damage, regions of underdosage close to the vessels, and areas in between these two extremes. When the power deposition is adjusted so that the peak thermal dose remains close to the threshold for thermal damage, the thermal dose is more uniformly distributed but under-dosage is still visible around the thermally significant vessels. The results of these simulations suggest that, for focused ultrasound, as for other delivery methods, the only way to control temperature is to adjust the average energy deposition to compensate for the presence of thermally significant vessels in the target area. By doing this, we have shown that it is possible to reduce the temperature heterogeneity observed in focused ultrasound thermal treatments.},

abstract = {This paper describes a face detection framework that is capable of processing images extremely rapidly while achieving high detection rates. There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the “Integral Image” which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a simple and efficient classifier which is built using the AdaBoost learning algo-rithm (Freund and Schapire, 1995) to select a small number of critical visual features from a very large set of potential features. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a “cascade” which allows back-ground regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising face-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection is presented. The system yields face detection perfor-mance comparable to the best previous systems (Sung and Poggio, 1998; Rowley et al., 1998; Schneiderman and Kanade, 2000; Roth et al., 2000). Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second.},

With the stimulus of this observation, the temperatures of the normal human forearm tissues and brachial arterial blood have been measured to evaluate the applicability of heat flow theory to the forearm in basic terms of local rate of tissue heat production and volume flow of blood.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Theoretical parametric and patient-specific models are applied to assess the feasibility of interstitial ultrasound ablation of tumours in and near the spine and to identify potential treatment delivery strategies. METHODS: 3D patient-specific finite element models (n = 11) of interstitial ultrasound ablation of tumours associated with the spine were generated. Gaseous nerve insulation and various applicator configurations, frequencies (3 and 7 MHz), placement trajectories, and tumour locations were simulated. Parametric studies with multilayered models investigated the impacts of tumour attenuation, tumour dimension, and the thickness of bone insulating critical structures. Temperature and thermal dose were calculated to define ablation ({\textgreater}240 equivalent minutes at 43 degrees C (EM43 degrees C)) and safety margins ({\textless}45 degrees C and {\textless}6 EM43 degrees C), and to determine performance and required delivery parameters. RESULTS: Osteolytic tumours ({\textless}/=44 mm) encapsulated by bone could be successfully ablated with 7 MHz interstitial ultrasound (8.1-16.6 W/cm(2), 120-5900 J, 0.4-15 min). Ablation of tumours (94.6-100{\%} volumetric) 0-14.5 mm from the spinal canal was achieved within 3-15 min without damaging critical nerves. 3 MHz devices provided faster ablation (390 versus 930 s) of an 18 mm diameter osteoblastic (high bone content) volume than 7 MHz devices. Critical anatomy in proximity to the tumour could be protected by selection of appropriate applicator configurations, active sectors, and applied power schemas, and through gaseous insulation. Preferential ultrasound absorption at bone surfaces facilitated faster, more effective ablations in osteolytic tumours and provided isolation of ablative energies and temperatures. CONCLUSIONS: Parametric and patient-specific studies demonstrated the feasibility and potential advantages of interstitial ultrasound ablation treatment of paraspinal and osteolytic vertebral tumours.},

abstract = {This brochure shows via several success stories the crucial contribution of mathematics to the industrial creation of value and the key position of mathematics in the handling of complex systems, amplifying innovation. Each story describes the challenge that led to the industrial cooperation, how the challenge was approached and how the solutions were achieved and implemented, and when brought together, they illustrate the versatile European landscape of projects in almost all areas of applied mathematics and across all business sectors. Today models are used everywhere to describe real world processes in the language of mathematics. The art of modelling is to focus on the important relationships to make the model as useful as possible to the user, and modelling therefore needs support from domain specialists. Indeed, close collaboration between industry experts and academia is both highly valued by all parties and highly valuable to successful projects. The next step after creating the mathematical model is the analysis or numerical simulation, to validate the model in comparison with experimental data and to investigate the robustness and sensitivity of the model. Once a mathematical model has been validated, then this model can be used to improve, optimize or control the process described. Model based control and optimization is a crucial element of automation in all areas of industry, often reducing the cost and time of product, process and service development and innovation. All of this is unthinkable without the existence of modern computers and information technology. However, the progress in computer technology is not alone sufficient for the future development of high technology innovation. Many of the success also rely to a large extent on the progress in the development of mathematical algorithms and tools. Although this brochure only describes a snapshot of all the European activities in industrial mathematics, it demonstrates that the level of cooperation between academia and industry is not equally well established throughout Europe and that there exists great opportunity for more industrial challenges to be addressed with the powerful ideas and tools at the disposal of mathematicians.

abstract = {Executive Summary CrowdEmotion produce software to measure a person's emotions based on analysis of microfacial expressions detected using a webcam. The technology relies on a machine learning algorithm to recognize which features correspond with which emotions; it is trained on a labelled dataset. The features are derived by applying a bank of Gabor filters to a set of frames, determining the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) of each resulting pixel, and then averaging the results over three orthogonal planes (TOP), as outlined in [1]. CrowdEmotion challenged the study group to improve the accuracy, processing speed and cost-efficiency of the tool. In particular they wanted to know if a subset of the bank of Gabor filters was sufficient, and whether the image filtering stage could be implemented on a GPU. A framework for choosing the optimum set of Gabor filters was established, and preliminary testing performed. Different ways of implementing Gabor filters were explored. Some elements of the feature set give little information, thus ways of reducing the dimensionality of this were interrogated. Some steps in the procedure outlined in [1] seemed ad-hoc, in particular when taking a subset of LBPs and choosing a gridding pattern to perform the TOP step. Taking a subset of LBPs was found to be fully justified. Meanwhile choosing a gridding pattern is open to interpretation; we make some suggestions on how this choice might be improved. A short review of alternatives to using a SVM as a classifier is presented.},
