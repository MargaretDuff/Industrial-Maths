abstract = {This paper describes a face detection framework that is capable of processing images extremely rapidly while achieving high detection rates. There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the “Integral Image” which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a simple and efficient classifier which is built using the AdaBoost learning algo-rithm (Freund and Schapire, 1995) to select a small number of critical visual features from a very large set of potential features. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a “cascade” which allows back-ground regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising face-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection is presented. The system yields face detection perfor-mance comparable to the best previous systems (Sung and Poggio, 1998; Rowley et al., 1998; Schneiderman and Kanade, 2000; Roth et al., 2000). Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second.},

abstract = {A precise definition of the basic reproduction number, R 0 , is presented for a general compartmental disease transmission model based on a system of ordinary differential equations. It is shown that, if R 0 {\textless} 1, then the disease free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable; whereas if R 0 {\textgreater} 1, then it is unstable. Thus, R 0 is a threshold parameter for the model. An analysis of the local centre manifold yields a simple criterion for the existence and stability of super-and sub-threshold endemic equilibria for R 0 near one. This criterion, together with the definition of R 0 , is illustrated by treatment, multigroup, staged progression, multistrain and vector-host models and can be applied to more complex models. The results are significant for disease control.},

abstract = {The relationship between housing costs and homelessness has important implications for the way that city and county governments respond to increasing homeless populations. Though many analyses in the public policy literature have examined inter-community variation in homelessness rates to identify causal mechanisms of homelessness (Byrne et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2003; Fargo et al., 2013), few studies have examined time-varying homeless counts within the same community (McCandless et al., 2016). To examine trends in homeless population counts in the 25 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, we develop a dynamic Bayesian hierarchical model for time-varying homeless count data. Particular care is given to modeling uncertainty in the homeless count generating and measurement processes, and a critical distinction is made between the counted number of homeless and the true size of the homeless population. For each metro under study, we investigate the relationship between increases in the Zillow Rent Index and increases in the homeless population. Sensitivity of inference to potential improvements in the accuracy of point-in-time counts is explored, and evidence is presented that the inferred increase in the rate of homelessness from 2011-2016 depends on prior beliefs about the accuracy of homeless counts. A main finding of the study is that the relationship between homelessness and rental costs is strongest in New York, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Seattle.},

abstract = {Research to assess the feasibility of developing a standoo active or passive optical tripwire detector is discussed. Reeectivities of typical tripwires and background materials were measured for UV, VNIR and SWIR wavelengths. A breadboard testbed was developed to obtain images of tripwires against various backgrounds for various geometries and a wide range of UV and VNIR wavelengths. Sample images of simulated and real tripwires in uncluttered environments and against typical cluttered backgrounds were acquired and analyzed. Line detection algorithms were applied to the images to detect tripwires. Although detection was not attempted in real-time, analysis showed that available, cost-eeective DSPs could potentially execute those algorithms on the images in real-time. The algorithms successfully detected tripwires in a heavily cluttered background and even have the capability to detect partially obscured wires. To complement the measurements, a spreadsheet model was developed to evaluate the merits of diierent detectors, sources of illumination, wavebands and geometries for diierent scenarios. Acceptable signal-to-clutter ratios were found for a number of reasonable passive and active illumination scenarios. The study demonstrated that an optical tripwire detector is feasible in principle.},

@article{Stockie2015,
abstract = {"I am an industrial mathematician." When asked to identify my profession or academic field of study, this is the most concise answer I can provide. However, this seemingly straightforward statement is commonly greeted by a blank stare or an uncomfortable silence, regardless of whether I am speaking to a fellow mathematician or a non-mathematician. I usually follow up with the clarification: "I am an applied mathematician who derives much of my inspiration from the study of industrial problems that I encounter through collaborations with companies." This dispels some confusion, but unfortunately still leaves a great deal open to interpretation owing to the vagueness of the words mathematics, industry and company, each of which covers an extremely broad range of scientific or socio-economic activity. To those academics who actually work in the field of industrial mathematics (and whose "perspective" referred to in the title is the focus of this article) this ambiguity is familiar and untroubling. However, for anyone less acquainted with the work of industrial mathematicians, some clarification is desirable especially for anyone who might be considering entering the field. This essay therefore aims to shed light upon the nature of research being done at the interface between mathematics and industry, paying particular attention to the following questions: What is industrial mathematics? Where is industrial mathematics? How does one do industrial mathematics? Why (or more precisely, what value is there in doing) industrial mathematics? I will attempt to answer these questions by means of several case studies drawn from my own experience in tackling mathematical problems from industry.},

@techreport{Celuszak2014,
abstract = {Executive Summary CrowdEmotion produce software to measure a person's emotions based on analysis of microfacial expressions detected using a webcam. The technology relies on a machine learning algorithm to recognize which features correspond with which emotions; it is trained on a labelled dataset. The features are derived by applying a bank of Gabor filters to a set of frames, determining the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) of each resulting pixel, and then averaging the results over three orthogonal planes (TOP), as outlined in [1]. CrowdEmotion challenged the study group to improve the accuracy, processing speed and cost-efficiency of the tool. In particular they wanted to know if a subset of the bank of Gabor filters was sufficient, and whether the image filtering stage could be implemented on a GPU. A framework for choosing the optimum set of Gabor filters was established, and preliminary testing performed. Different ways of implementing Gabor filters were explored. Some elements of the feature set give little information, thus ways of reducing the dimensionality of this were interrogated. Some steps in the procedure outlined in [1] seemed ad-hoc, in particular when taking a subset of LBPs and choosing a gridding pattern to perform the TOP step. Taking a subset of LBPs was found to be fully justified. Meanwhile choosing a gridding pattern is open to interpretation; we make some suggestions on how this choice might be improved. A short review of alternatives to using a SVM as a classifier is presented.},

@techreport{Byatt-Smith2003,
abstract = {A simple model is proposed for the changes in numbers of homeless households, of those of people housed in the private sector and of those resident in council housing. The model, which applies to a single local authority, is analysed to see how changing priorities can affect waiting times and the size of the waiting list for council accommodation. The analysis shows that, if the number of homeless is reasonably small, then altering the priority given to them makes little difference to the waiting times for other members of the population. However, lowering the priority given to rehousing the homeless significantly increases the time which they have to wait. Time scales which appear in the model indicate that the determination of steady states will not always suffice to predict the sizes of waiting lists over times of practical interest. A possible sensitive dependence on the amount of housing stock is also found.},
