@article{Viola2004,
abstract = {This paper describes a face detection framework that is capable of processing images extremely rapidly while achieving high detection rates. There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the “Integral Image” which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a simple and efficient classifier which is built using the AdaBoost learning algo-rithm (Freund and Schapire, 1995) to select a small number of critical visual features from a very large set of potential features. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a “cascade” which allows back-ground regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising face-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection is presented. The system yields face detection perfor-mance comparable to the best previous systems (Sung and Poggio, 1998; Rowley et al., 1998; Schneiderman and Kanade, 2000; Roth et al., 2000). Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second.},

@article{Stockie2015,
abstract = {"I am an industrial mathematician." When asked to identify my profession or academic field of study, this is the most concise answer I can provide. However, this seemingly straightforward statement is commonly greeted by a blank stare or an uncomfortable silence, regardless of whether I am speaking to a fellow mathematician or a non-mathematician. I usually follow up with the clarification: "I am an applied mathematician who derives much of my inspiration from the study of industrial problems that I encounter through collaborations with companies." This dispels some confusion, but unfortunately still leaves a great deal open to interpretation owing to the vagueness of the words mathematics, industry and company, each of which covers an extremely broad range of scientific or socio-economic activity. To those academics who actually work in the field of industrial mathematics (and whose "perspective" referred to in the title is the focus of this article) this ambiguity is familiar and untroubling. However, for anyone less acquainted with the work of industrial mathematicians, some clarification is desirable especially for anyone who might be considering entering the field. This essay therefore aims to shed light upon the nature of research being done at the interface between mathematics and industry, paying particular attention to the following questions: What is industrial mathematics? Where is industrial mathematics? How does one do industrial mathematics? Why (or more precisely, what value is there in doing) industrial mathematics? I will attempt to answer these questions by means of several case studies drawn from my own experience in tackling mathematical problems from industry.},

abstract = {Executive Summary CrowdEmotion produce software to measure a person's emotions based on analysis of microfacial expressions detected using a webcam. The technology relies on a machine learning algorithm to recognize which features correspond with which emotions; it is trained on a labelled dataset. The features are derived by applying a bank of Gabor filters to a set of frames, determining the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) of each resulting pixel, and then averaging the results over three orthogonal planes (TOP), as outlined in [1]. CrowdEmotion challenged the study group to improve the accuracy, processing speed and cost-efficiency of the tool. In particular they wanted to know if a subset of the bank of Gabor filters was sufficient, and whether the image filtering stage could be implemented on a GPU. A framework for choosing the optimum set of Gabor filters was established, and preliminary testing performed. Different ways of implementing Gabor filters were explored. Some elements of the feature set give little information, thus ways of reducing the dimensionality of this were interrogated. Some steps in the procedure outlined in [1] seemed ad-hoc, in particular when taking a subset of LBPs and choosing a gridding pattern to perform the TOP step. Taking a subset of LBPs was found to be fully justified. Meanwhile choosing a gridding pattern is open to interpretation; we make some suggestions on how this choice might be improved. A short review of alternatives to using a SVM as a classifier is presented.},

The approach is based on time series and regression methods for forecasting an optimal amount of money that should be placed daily in the ATMs in order to meet customers' demands and mimimize costs of the bank. Three different types of costs were considered: cash freezing costs, transportation costs and insurance costs. The performance of the resulting forecasts were compared with results of the application that bank uses for prediciton of the time and the amount of filling-in for each ATM based on historical data. i Optimization of ATMs filling-in with cash ESGI 99},

abstract = {Research to assess the feasibility of developing a standoo active or passive optical tripwire detector is discussed. Reeectivities of typical tripwires and background materials were measured for UV, VNIR and SWIR wavelengths. A breadboard testbed was developed to obtain images of tripwires against various backgrounds for various geometries and a wide range of UV and VNIR wavelengths. Sample images of simulated and real tripwires in uncluttered environments and against typical cluttered backgrounds were acquired and analyzed. Line detection algorithms were applied to the images to detect tripwires. Although detection was not attempted in real-time, analysis showed that available, cost-eeective DSPs could potentially execute those algorithms on the images in real-time. The algorithms successfully detected tripwires in a heavily cluttered background and even have the capability to detect partially obscured wires. To complement the measurements, a spreadsheet model was developed to evaluate the merits of diierent detectors, sources of illumination, wavebands and geometries for diierent scenarios. Acceptable signal-to-clutter ratios were found for a number of reasonable passive and active illumination scenarios. The study demonstrated that an optical tripwire detector is feasible in principle.},
